# Interpretable Clustering of PS-InSAR Time Series for Ground Deformation Detection

This is the repo for the paper "[Interpretable Clustering of PS-InSAR Time Series for Ground Deformation Detection](https://link.tbd)"
by Claudia Masciulli, Giacomo Guiduzzi, Donato Tiano, Marta Zocchi,
Francesco Guerra, Paolo Mazzanti and Gabriele Scarascia Mugnozza.

The repo is structured as follows:
- `data`: contains the data used in the paper
- `src`: contains the source code
- `time2feat`: contains the code for the [Time2Feat](https://github.com/softlab-unimore/time2feat) model
- `featts`: contains the code for the [FeaTTS](https://github.com/protti/FeatTS) model

Both models are available as Python packages on PyPI and are configured as git submodules in this repo.
